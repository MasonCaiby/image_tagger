Hey this is currently a work in progress, but I think I have the basic functionality down. You can set a directory to pull images in from and draw bounding boxes with your mouse. It currently allows for 10 classes (1-9, 0). You can tag as many objects in a window as you want. The goal of this project is to make the fastest bounding box drawing tool I can. so the first class is 1, the last is 0. This way a right handed person on a laptop can keep their left hand on the number line and not jump from 0 to 1 when labelling just a few classes.

Additional commands:

`space_bar: next image`

`q: saves all progress and quits process`

`r: refreshes the image, erasing all bounding boxes`

`x: if you have clicked on a bounding box then press x it will delete the box`
